Pom 1: Created some states.
Pom 2: Define the function makeMove.
- [X] Now we need a model for how Tic Tac Toe works:
  - [X] Create tictactoe.ts
  - [X] Define a type GameState that can represent everything about a tic-tac-toe game
- [X] Add a function called makeMove that takes a game + player + move location and returns a new GameState

:END:
- [X] Wire up GameState and makeMove into your React component
- [X] Add detection of winners
   bruhhhhhhhhhhhh.
- [X] Add move validation (can’t make moves after a win)
*** Questions
- [X] Don’t forget to write in #eod
** Day 3 Express Server
*** Docset Skills
=SPC s k= lookup in docsets
=SPC s K= lookup in all docsets

=K= is always reliable =+lookup/documentation= aka =SPC c k=

=SPC c d= lookup definition
=SPC c D= lookup *references* (uses of symbol)
- Also try =evil-goto-definition=

=SPC s o= is lookup /online/. Queries the browser on high quality documentation sources ala =K=

=g ;= and =g ,= are =evil-goto-last-change=

make sure to activate docsets before using dash-doc features?

- [X] show celebration
  In order to show a celebration, we already have a console displaying.
  - [X] So I just need to add a display on the html
  - [X] and then separate out the display text to an independent component
  - [X] Merge Current Player message into Celebration too

- [ ] Modify error handling message dispatch for wrong player?
  - [ ] This is not too relevant at the moment, But I can look up the proper "error display" / throw exception display feature.

- [X] Modify error handling for wrong target to return current gamestate
  - [X] i can leave this as is.

spin off to dev-express-server
- [X] Set up Vite-Express on your existing tic-tac-toe app
- [X] Modify bun run dev to run server.ts
  - I [[https://github.com/szymmis/vite-express?tab=readme-ov-file#fresh-setup-with-create-vite][followed this procedure]] which allowed me to install packages.
  - Then I modified package.json to run
    : "dev": "bun run --watch ./src/server/main.ts"
    And since that particular script has ViteExpress in, it re-routes all un-specified routes to the client code that would normally run when you call ~vite~

feat 1a: in-memory
- [ ] Add a /game (GET) and /move (POST) endpoints
- [ ] move makeMove to the server, manage the game state in-memory
merge to server-setup

feat 1b:
- [ ] Use React Query and fetch to read and write game data via a server
merge to server-setup


- [ ] Goal State:
  - [ ] your game has identical functionality, but all game state is managed by the server
  - [ ] game state persists if you refresh the tab, but not if you restart the server
merge to main

spin off to dev-multi-game

- [ ] Now we need to support multiple games.
- [ ] Add game ID to the GameState model
- [ ] Add game ID to /game and /move
- [ ] Add a list of games: GET /games and a create game endpoint: /create
- [ ] Now we need to allow a user to pick a game:
  - [ ] Add a new "pick/create game" component that displays initially
  - [ ] Once a game ID is selected, display the normal tic-tac-toe component
- [ ] Goal State:
  - [ ] your game allows users to join an existing game or start a new one
  - [ ] each tic-tac-toe game functions as normal (detects winners, ties, etc.)
  - [ ] states persist between chrome tab refreshes, but not server restarts
